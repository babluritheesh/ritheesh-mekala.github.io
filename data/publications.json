    "abstract": "Traditional methods of performance tuning in Database Management Systems (DBMS) are facing significant challenges in adapting to the dynamic nature of modern workloads. This paper proposes a novel approach for workload-based performance tuning through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), leveraging machine learning and predictive modeling to automate workload analysis and dynamically adjust DBMS configurations for optimal performance.",
